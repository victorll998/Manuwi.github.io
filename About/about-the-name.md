_About the name_ Manuwi (Mundowie) origins from early 19th century Australian pidgin, and it is from Dharuk (one of the Australian Aboriginal languages) which means “foot”. It is another way of interpretation of our travel planner.

We value Australian Aboriginal culture and we hope that we share pride in our designs and products.
