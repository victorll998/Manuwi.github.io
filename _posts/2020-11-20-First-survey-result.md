[The first round of survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nvT8GeYFSdeWW8I0RFUj0b00rCsygJ-8F8c0bvktTko/edit) is targeted to research market. The survey is composed of 10 questions over interests and concerns when people planning travel. 

We surveyed our close friends and got **10** sample for this first round survey.

As result, we found out that they need helps **when planning travel with their friends**. The survey shows that people can indecisive when it comes to decisions with **accommodation**, **transportation** and **restaurant**. Most of them use google spreadsheets and WhatsApp to keep on track of their group travel plan but it does not provide **security**, **budget** and **activities** they are looking for. They want a tool they can use to **compare price, review and travel time to better plan a trip with friends**.
