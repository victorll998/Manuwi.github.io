### About Manuwi

> “Post COVID-19 recovery: Sustainability and Resilience”

We have seen Australian tourism that has been hit hard by COVID-19 and bushfires last year.

We also have seen small businesses that have been suffered losses and need to close during level 4 lockdown.

We are now promoting sustainability into our awareness to highlight the idea of cost-efficient and time-efficient, developing resilience that helps the transition of post COVID-19 era.

We create a fun experience when planning travel by using our application manuwi to collaborate with friends to decide travel destinations and compare different options of destinations.
