### About Manuwi

> “Post COVID-19 recovery: Sustainability and Resilience”

We have seen Australian tourism that has been hit hard by COVID-19 and bushfires last year.

We also have seen small businesses that have been suffered losses and need to close during level 4 lockdown.

We are now promoting sustainability into our awareness to highlight the idea of cost-efficient and time-efficient, developing resilience that helps the transition of post COVID-19 era.

We create a fun experience when planning travel by using our application manuwi to collaborate with friends to decide travel destinations and compare different options of destinations.

[About the name]({% link About/about-the-name.md %})

_About the name_ Manuwi (Mundowie) origins from early 19th century Australian pidgin, and it is from Dharuk (one of the Australian Aboriginal languages) which means “foot”. It is another way of interpretation of our travel planner.

We value Australian Aboriginal culture and we hope that we share pride in our designs and products.
